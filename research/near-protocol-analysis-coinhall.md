# NEAR Protocol

## Get to know (TLDR/One-liner)

- L1 blockchain that uses [sharding](https://near.org/papers/nightshade/#sharding-basics) to achieve scalability as opposed to main-/side-chain as seen in Cosmos and Polkadot.
- Uses an [account](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/account), and every wallet is a smart contract.

## What's in their ecosystem?

- There are a lot of [projects](https://awesomenear.com/projects) ranging from the usual dapps to infra such as explorers and bridges.
  - You might be familiar with Multichain or Rainbow Bridge
- NEAR API [RPC and REST](https://docs.near.org/docs/api/overview)
  - [Sample code](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/master/examples/cookbook/transactions/get-tx-detail.js) to get transacrion details.

### Grants/Funding

- [NEAR Foundation Grants Program](https://near.org/grants/)
  - Fast grants (<= USD 50k in NEAR)
  - Standard grants ( USD 50k - 250k in NEAR)
- [Refer & Earn](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xyLY4AmX7oX8PtirIhAAjwFRJFFR3oMN5mE8Iihg1pk)
- Foundation does **NOT** accept application for DeFi grants.

### Market Opportunity

- Charting and data (analytics) are still up for grabs but it *may* be contested as existing Aurora projects like DexScreener (NEAR's EVM) port/build on the main chain.
- Potentially working with [octopus network](https://oct.network/) which plans to work cross-chain to DOT and the IBC.

### Consideration to be a Validator/Node Operator

- Capital ([Seat Price](https://explorer.near.org/nodes/validators)): ~197K (200k) NEAR self-bonded AND delegated([*](https://near-nodes.io/validator/validator-bootcamp#becoming-a-validator)) -- Top 100 are active
  - Bond breakdown - Unable to determine, does not seem like there is a foundation backing these validators
  - Rewards - 10.8% APR ([*](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/near-protocol/)), seems like rewards are only dependent on how much NEAR the validator has.
    - Lowest reward: 1641.66 NEAR/month
- [H/W Requirements](https://near-nodes.io/validator/hardware)
    1. 8-core CPU
    2. 16GB RAM
    3. 1TB (NVME)
- Recommendation: My main concern for this chain is that it's might end up being a VC dumping ground, but apart from that the chain seems to be relatively active with hackathons and grants and might be a good place for devs in general.
